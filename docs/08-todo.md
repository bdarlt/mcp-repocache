# TODO and Next Steps

---

## Immediate Tasks
- [ ] Implement Zim storage in `mcp/storage.py`
- [ ] Implement semantic indexing in `mcp/semantic.py`
- [ ] Add logging to all modules
- [ ] Add configuration file support (e.g., `config.yaml` for repo URLs, API keys)

---

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Dockerize the project
- [ ] Add authentication to the API
- [ ] Support incremental updates (only fetch/index new commits)
- [ ] Add a frontend for the API
- [ ] Support more document formats (e.g., reStructuredText, HTML)

---

## Open Questions
- Should the semantic indexer support multiple models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)?
- How should versioning be handled for documents?
- Should the API support GraphQL in addition to REST?
